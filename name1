        Hello, my name is Jerred Carter, and I am passionate about Art and Technology. 
        I like to implement technology into a creative process which allows me to express how I perceive art and the world through my eyes. Learning how to <strong>program</strong> is not just an opening to a career for me; 
        itâ€™s a way to <strong>express</strong> my creativity and try to further push the limits of media boundaries.
    </p>

        I come from a small town between Lumberton and Fayetteville called St.Pauls. 
        It doesnt have a lot of things going for it but like everything in life its constantly growing and changing and I just hope its for the better. The town quote is "A small town with a big heart". Thinking of this makes me feel like I'm back home.
